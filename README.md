# Theoretical-calculation-of-an-electric-vehicle-s-energy-demand-using-MATLAB
This project focuses on the theoretical calculation of an electric vehicleâ€™s energy demand using the EUDC (European Driving Cycle) as a reference. The objective is to generate an algorithm in MATLAB and evaluate the dynamic vehicle parameters and compute the vehicle demand energy over a complete drive cycle.
