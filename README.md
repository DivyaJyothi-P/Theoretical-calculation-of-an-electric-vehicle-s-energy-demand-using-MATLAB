# Theoretical-calculation-of-an-electric-vehicle-s-energy-demand-using-MATLAB
This project focuses on the theoretical calculation of an electric vehicleâ€™s energy demand using the EUDC (European Driving Cycle) as a reference input. The analysis is carried out using MATLAB scripting,with a focus on understanding the power,force and Energy requirements of an EV under European Driving Cycle conditions.
## What This Project Includes
-Calculation of **Total tractive force**,**Instantanious power** and **Energy demand**
-Plotting of key results to visualize how Power,Force and Energy vary over velocity 
-Visualization and understanding trends is emphasised
## Tools Used
-MATLAB R2025a
-Simulink
-European Driving Cycle dataset
## Output Highlights
-Total resistance force(N) vs Velocity(m/s) plot
-Total power(w) vs Velocity(m/s) plot
-Energy consumed(J) vs Velocity(m/s) plot
-EUDC drive cycle plot-Time(sec) vs velocity(m/s)
